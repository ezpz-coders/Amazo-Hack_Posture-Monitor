<h3 align = "center"> Problem Statement </h3>

<h4 align = "left">Postural dysfunction or “Poor” posture is defined as when our spine is positioned in unnatural positions, in which the curves are emphasised and this results in the joints, muscles and vertebrae being in stressful positions. This prolonged poor positioning results in a build up of pressure on these tissues.</h4>


<h3 align = "center"> Why it is a problem? </h3>

<h4 align = "left">This is a common issue nowadays, most of the work is being done in front of computer screens, sitting for long hours with a bad posture may lead to serious health issues. Apart from that we indulge ourselves to much that we don't even realize our posture.</h4>

<h3 align = "center"> Our Solution </h3>
<h4 align = "left">We are developing a offline solution which will trigger a notification whenever our posture is bad for more than certain amount of time. So you can easily monitor your posture. You can choose "time" and "strictness" as per your needs</h4>

<h3 align = "center"> Is it safe? </h3>
<h4 align = "left">Yes, even though we use webcam to monitor your posture, we do not prompt any online connection and nothing is saved locally, the variables exist as long as the app is running.</h4>

<h3 align = "center"> Tech Used </h3>

<h3 align = "center"> How is works? </h3>
<h4 align = "left">We initially ask user to sit in ideal posture and then capture their posture points, if user strays from those points for too long then we will trigger notification.</h4>
